To use the script you will need to download [Tesseract-OCR](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki)(*last tested working on 30/06/2025*) and change the path of the Tesseract-OCR(*in line 17*) to the path you installed in your system.

1. Put the PDFs to be transcribed into the input folder and run the script.
2. The script will run and a compiler folder will be made collecting the transcribed pages.
3. once the script has fully transcribed the pages of the the current PDF, it will stop or move on to the next file, depending if there is more files in the input folder.
